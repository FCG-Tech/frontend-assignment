Description of FCG Reg&Tech technical frontend interview assignment

The assignment is to create a simple web application that list items (in this case survey forms) from a REST API in a drop-down selection list. There is no need to host the application somewhere.
When the user select a survey, the form should be dynamically generated based on form data.
It should be able to fill in answers to the selected form, and also set a "Participant name" of the form.
Post filled in form data (including formId and participantName) to API.

The schema of REST API is provided together with the url to call.

An example of page sketch is provided. Please notice, this is just an example since the form might look different dependent on selected survey form. The yellow cards are comments. 

Requirements:

- Use Typescript
- Select a library (e.g. React, Angular etc.) of your preferences
- Commit your code into gitHub repository and send the link to the repository at least 1 hour before interview to anna.flodby@fcg.se and magnus.berglund@fcg.se
- Include a README file into the repository with guidelines what to install (e.g. Node.js, Yarn etc.) and how to run the code
- Style the page of your preferences but the page needs to contain the main components described in the sketch

Technical interview:
During the interview we will use the assignment as a material of discussion. Be prepared to show us what you have done.
